# 🛌 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data Analysis

This project explores statistical insights from the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset**, containing around 400 records and 13 variables related to sleep duration, physical activity, stress level, and more. The aim was to analyze how lifestyle variables influence sleep quality and identify trends using visual and statistical techniques.

## 🧱 Project Milestones

### 🏁 Milestone 1: Data Exploration & Descriptive Statistics

- **Objective:** Understand structure, central tendencies, and variance of key features.
- **Tasks Completed:**
  - Loaded dataset and selected relevant numerical variables.
  - Computed descriptive statistics for:
    - Age: Mean = 42.18, SD = 8.67
    - Sleep Duration: Mean = 7.13 hours, SD = 0.8
    - Daily Steps: Mean = 6816.84, SD = 1617.92
    - Stress Level: Mean = 5.39, SD = 1.77
  - Cleaned missing values (final N = 374).
  - Created 3-line summary tables for key variables.

### 📊 Milestone 2: Visual Explorations and Insights

- **Objective:** Visualize distributions and relationships across lifestyle dimensions.
- **Key Visualizations:**
  - **Scatter Plot (Sleep Duration vs. Age):**
    - Older individuals (>52) generally sleep more than average.
  - **Stress vs. Age Plot:**
    - Younger individuals report higher stress.
  - **Jitter Plot (Age vs. Daily Steps):**
    - Highlights step variability across age groups.
  - **Jitter Plot (Sleep Duration vs. Stress):**
    - Less sleep correlates with higher stress levels.
  - **Boxplot (Daily Steps by Gender):**
    - Identified female outliers with high physical activity.
  - **Boxplot (Stress by Gender):**
    - Females generally show lower median stress levels.

## 🧠 Final Insights & Recommendations

- Individuals with **low sleep quality** tend to:
  - Sleep less
  - Be less physically active
  - Have higher stress levels
- **Positive lifestyle behaviors** (e.g., physical activity, enough sleep) correlate with:
  - Better sleep quality
  - Lower stress levels
- **Gender differences:**
  - Males tend to have higher stress levels than females.
- **Outliers** found through boxplots provided additional qualitative understanding.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Apply regression modeling to predict stress or sleep quality.
- Include categorical analysis (e.g., job type, marital status).
- Build a dashboard using Shiny for dynamic insights.
